The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page. Source
Basically, when a browser loads a page it creates an object model of that page and prints it on the screen. The object model is represented in a tree data structure, each node is an object with properties and methods, and the topmost node is the document object.

A programming language can be used to access and modify this object model, and this action is called DOM manipulation. And we will do that with JavaScript because JS is awesome.
